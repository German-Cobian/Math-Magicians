# Math-Magicians

A single page React app whose main feature is a fully functioning basic calculator as one of it's pages,

![Math-Magicians](/public/math-magicians-2.png?raw=true "Calculator-page")

...  but also includes a landing page,

![Math-Magicians](/public/math-magicians-1.png?raw=true "Home-page")

... and a page where the user can read a random math-related quote.

The most significant aspect of this app is the manner in which the calculator logic was adapted so that the display of its operations could be handled by React components.
